Example bot implementation for [checkers-bot](https://github.com/tleyden/checkers-bot)

# Install 

First you will need to [install Go 1.1](http://golang.org/doc/install) or later.

```
$ go get github.com/tleyden/checkers-bot-random
$ go get github.com/couchbaselabs/go.assert
```
# Validate installation - run tests

```
$ cd $GOPATH/github.com/tleyden/checkers-bot-random
$ go test -v
```

# Install Couchbase Server

# Install [Sync Gateway](https://github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway)

# Install [Checkers Overlord](https://github.com/apage43/checkers-overlord)

# Install Checkers Lite

Not strictly required, but very useful in order to view the game.

The other way to install [Checkers-iOS](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/Checkers-iOS) from github.  Unfortunately it is a private repo at the time of this writing.  Contact [wacarter](https://github.com/wacarter) if you are interested in getting the source code.

It can be installed via the [iTunes Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id698034787), however that version is only able to connect to the non-public production server.
